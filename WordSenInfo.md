# WordSen - Japanese Language Learning App

## What WordSen Does

WordSen is an innovative Japanese language learning app that makes mastering Japanese vocabulary feel natural and engaging. Unlike traditional study methods that rely on cramming, WordSen uses a scientifically-proven spaced repetition system (SRS) that learns how well you know each word and presents them at the perfect moment for maximum retention.

Think of WordSen as your personal Japanese tutor that never forgets where you left off. The app tracks your progress with each flashcard, gradually spacing out reviews as you become more confident with words, and bringing back challenging ones more frequently. This means you'll spend time learning new vocabulary while reinforcing what you've already studied, without wasting time on words you've already mastered.

What makes WordSen special is its holistic approach to learning. The app doesn't just show you isolated words - it presents Japanese vocabulary within complete sentences, giving you context for how words are actually used. This sentence-based learning helps you understand not just what words mean, but how they fit into real conversations and written Japanese.

The app features beautiful, clean flashcards with an intuitive rating system (😊 for easy, 😐 for moderate, 😞 for difficult) that helps the algorithm understand your confidence level with each word. As you progress, WordSen celebrates your achievements with visual progress indicators and keeps you motivated by showing how words move through different learning stages - from locked content, through active learning, into review mode, and finally to mastered vocabulary.

For those who want to go deeper, WordSen includes an integrated Unity-based game component that transforms vocabulary practice into an immersive gaming experience, making long study sessions feel more like play than work.
